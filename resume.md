**Professional Experience**

November 2013 - Present **Rackspace, The #1 Managed Cloud Company, San Antonio, TX (Remote)**
*Linux Systems Administrator II*

I've been working for the past year as a Linux Systems Administrator, as part of a team supporting enterprise customers.  Our team supports the majority of the Magento ecommerce customers in Rackspace's enterprise group.  Routinely work multiple issues at one time, and have been repeatedly commended for both ownership of issues, technical expertise, and the rapport and ability to explain complex technical issues to customers.

**Accomplishments**

* Met or exceeded all goals including including ticket work, phone availability, etc.

* Completed RHCSA, RCHE certifications, as well as several internal Rackspace training programs related to storage, clustering, and cloud technologies.

* Became a knoweledge center for Magento and its related services for my team.

* Routinely tasked with specific projects by account teams

* Served as an explanation point for junior administrators, helping them learn how to troubleshoot complex Linux problems.


June 2009 - October 2013 **Internet Marketing Ninjas Clifton Park, NY**

*SR Systems Administrator -> Director of IT*

Began working at a growing company without an IT team, and with an entirely undocumented desktop, network, and server infrastructure.  After an initial transition period lasting several months, I began to plan new systems to handle the company tripling in size, and led the team that moved the company two times, working with electricians, HVAC, and other trades.  I've been mentoring and training a JR systems administrator for the past year, and have successfully handed off many day to day tasks which have allowed me to focus on large scale systems, auditing, and accounting.  Finally, I've been working with the development team to push devops principles, including the importance of configuration management, code deployments, and the importance of testing.



**Accomplishments**

* Design, Implementation, and Support of a Rackspace hybrid cloud web hosting platform using Percona MySQL, Apache, NGINX, Memcached to serve 100GB a day in traffic.

* Migration of most servers to use the Puppet configuration management platform.

* Design, implementation, operation, and training on Nagios and Check_MK monitoring solution for over 300 servers, thousands of services, and hundreds of web hosting domains.

* Provide a free, Open Source highly available virtualization platform, using KVM and the Ganeti Virtualization manager.  Live migrations, failover, and snapshotting are all supported on a free platform.  This solution saved over $50,000 in licensing costs across several clusters.

* Provide highly available Linux HTTP and NFS services using Heartbeat, and LVM, DRBD, mdadm and Dell PERC Raid

* Design, implementation, and operation of a desktop linux infrastructure including remote home directories and Active Directory authentication.





October 2000 - May 2009 **Seagroatt Floral Company Albany, NY**

*Intern -> Systems Administrator -> SR Systems Administrator*



I spent several years learning from two mentors who worked as systems administrators and developers part time. I took over sole IT admin duties, working with a programmer, as the company grew from one location to five locations. I provided all core IT services (backup, monitoring, DNS, file serving, etc). I provided a secure VPN between all sites, managed hosting and multiple ISPs, provided desktop and server support, and handled all service contracts for entire enterprise.



**Accomplishments**
